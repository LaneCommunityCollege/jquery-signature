# jQuery Signature
A quick website to generate an email signature based on form input, with a little bit of validation. Users then copy and paste their signature into their email client.

An example can be found on [our website](https://smallapps.lanecc.edu/signature-generator/).

## Resources
* **CSS Icons** - https://github.com/krschmidt/css-icons - since image icons don't work well in email
* **CSS Inliner** - https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/ - since all css needs to be inlined.
